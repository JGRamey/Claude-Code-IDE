## 🏗️ New Architecture Overview

### **Before (Old Architecture):**
```
Main Claude Code → Orchestrator Subagent → Worker Subagents
                        ↓
                   Evaluator Agent
```

### **After (New Architecture):**
```
Main Claude Code Session (Natural Orchestrator)
    ├── Frontend Architect (+ Playwright)
    ├── Backend Architect
    ├── UI/UX Designer (+ Playwright)  
    ├── Test Architect
    ├── Database Specialist
    ├── DevOps Specialist
    └── Documentor
```

### **Key Benefits:**
- **Direct Communication**: No intermediate orchestrator layer
- **Natural Coordination**: Conversational task delegation
- **Integrated Evaluation**: Quality assessment built into main session
- **Enhanced Testing**: Visual validation with Playwright tools
- **Efficient Search**: Serena MCP for smart code analysis

- **Enhanced Capabilities**: Playwright visual testing integration
- **Improved Workflow**: Natural language coordination
- **Quality Integration**: Built-in evaluation and quality assessment
- **Future-Ready**: Scalable architecture for additional specialized agents

### **Agent Count:**
- **Previous**: 9 agents (including orchestrator + evaluator)
- **Current**: 7 specialized agents + Main Claude Session orchestrator
- **Reduction**: More efficient with better capabilities
