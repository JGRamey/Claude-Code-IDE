- **Validation**: No current documentation contains outdated paths
- **Decision**: Historical logs left unchanged as accurate record of past events
- **Impact**: All current documentation uses correct `chat_logs/orchestrator/` path

### [TASK-4] - Comprehensive System Validation
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED
- **File System Verification**:
  - âœ… No orchestrator.md files remain anywhere in project
  - âœ… No evaluator.md files remain anywhere in project  
  - âœ… Agent count verified: 7 specialized agents + README
  - âœ… Chat log directory structure correct
- **Tool Configuration Verification**:
  - âœ… Frontend-architect has full Playwright MCP tool suite
  - âœ… UI-UX maintains existing Playwright tools
  - âœ… Serena MCP documented for main session
  - âœ… Context7 MCP documented as mandatory for agents
- **Architecture Verification**:
  - âœ… All workflow patterns reflect main session orchestration
  - âœ… Communication protocols updated
  - âœ… No orphaned references to removed subagents

## Key Decisions Made

### 1. **Chat Log Directory Structure**
- **Decision**: Use `chat_logs/orchestrator/` as primary main session log directory
- **Rationale**: User preference and logical organization
- **Implementation**: Updated all documentation to reference correct paths

### 2. **Historical Log Preservation**
- **Decision**: Preserve historical references to `chat_logs/main/` in old session logs
- **Rationale**: Maintain accurate historical record of actual events
- **Implementation**: Updated only current/future documentation, left historical logs unchanged

### 3. **Documentation Standards**
- **Decision**: Transform agent_update.md into permanent project documentation
- **Rationale**: Provide comprehensive record for stakeholders and future development
- **Implementation**: Complete rewrite with verification checklists and impact analysis

## Agent Interactions & Delegations

### Direct Agent System Management
- **No external agent delegations**: This session focused on system-level documentation and architecture
- **Self-orchestration**: Main Claude session performed all tasks directly
- **Quality Control**: Applied evaluator duties throughout session for quality assurance

## Technical Implementations

### File System Changes
```
Files Modified:
â”œâ”€â”€ CLAUDE.md                     â†’ Added main session logging section
â””â”€â”€ agent_update.md              â†’ Complete rewrite as status report

Files Verified (No Changes Needed):
â”œâ”€â”€ .claude/agents/README.md      â†’ Architecture correctly updated
â”œâ”€â”€ .claude/agents/frontend-architect.md â†’ Playwright tools confirmed
â”œâ”€â”€ chat_logs/templates/*.md      â†’ Templates correctly updated
